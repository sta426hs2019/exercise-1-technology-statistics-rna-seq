## RNA-Seq (Sevi)

### Direct and indirect RNA seq (Julian)


### Library preparation 

By reverse transcribing an RNA of interest, a more stable cDNA can be generated and used for further amplification. Direct ultra-high-throughput sequencing of the cDNA allows quantifiction of sequence reads and individual mapping to the source genome. [2]
