### Direct and indirect RNA seq (Julian)

RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) uses next generation sequencing (NGS) to examine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample. The first step in the indirect RNA-seq involves converting the population of RNA to be sequenced into cDNA fragments. There exists direct RNA sequencing, that allows massively parallel sequencing of RNA molecules directly without prior synthesis of cDNA. [1]  

### Library preparation 

By reverse transcribing an RNA of interest, a more stable cDNA can be generated and used for further amplification. Direct ultra-high-throughput sequencing of the cDNA allows quantifiction of sequence reads and individual mapping to the source genome. [2]
