# Bisulphite-Sequencing

Epigenetic mechanisms may lead to different expressions of identical DNA sequences. One of these mechanisms is Cytosin methylation, repressing transcriptional activity.
These DNA alterations can be studied via Bisulphite-Sequencing: 

## Technology

Bisulphite treatment of DNA converts cytosine, but not methylated cytosine, to uracil. Subsequent high-throughput sequencing yields high-resolution resolution information about the methylation status of the DNA.
