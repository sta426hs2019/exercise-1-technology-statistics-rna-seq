Epigenetic mechanisms may lead to different expressions of identical DNA sequences. One of these mechanisms is Cytosin methylation, repressing transcriptional activity.
These DNA alterations can be studied via **Bisulphite-Sequencing**: 

## Technology

Bisulphite treatment of DNA converts cytosine, but not methylated cytosine, to uracil. Subsequent high-throughput sequencing yields high-resolution resolution information about the methylation status of the DNA. [^1]

## Application

## Statistics

Complete linkeage hierarchical clustering, Pearson correlation [^1]

Regression-based methods, e.g. methylKit, BiSeq, 
Smoothing-based methods, e.g. BSmooth 
Hidden Markov models: HMM-DM and HMM-Fisher [^2]
